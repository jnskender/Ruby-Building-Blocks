#Ruby Challenges
This repository includes my solutions to multiple programming challenges given at [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming)

These challenges showcase my knowledge of the Ruby language and my ability to problem solve with the language at an Intermediate level.

This is in an effort to become more comfortable with Ruby before I dive into Rails development.
